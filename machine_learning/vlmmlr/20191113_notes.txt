Vikram -- chalk talk
Linking Rosetta against TensorFlow libraries, inputs and outputs between the two
	Vikram, Sergey, Jack

There's an issue with how TF takes over a GPU. Instead, Vikram is making a COU-based program that manages access to the GPU. RosettaTensorflowManager. This ties in with Vikram's other work on multithreading different parts of Rosetta.

Can evaluate derivatives as well as a neural network, perform saliency analysis. 

Merging master soon
Currently some hard-coded parts, can't make it fully general yet.

Next meeting 12/4 (3 weeks, not 2)
