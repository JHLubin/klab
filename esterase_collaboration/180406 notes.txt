protein-protein interaction detection for imaging applications
phenols to esterase
This one can be extracellular

Porcine liver esterase is what you're using, but what was sent is a different one that is 95% homologous
Actual target: 5FV4

Some NNK mutagenesis near active site
screened for positive hits
Picking AA positions, primers to single-site mutate

Val474 ->R (1475 pymol), Gly468->R (1469 in pymol), Glutamate221->Y (1220 in pymol)
improved activity
468 truncation improved activity with frame shift
G468 was left, then the following sequence: MRSSLGSDFHC-stop

Eventually want split enzyme, selective for large ester groups
Have attempted 72 splits, some have worked

PACE doesn't work so well with these mamalian proteins

Maybe select against methyl small molecule, while favoring the cpef

L358, M362, and M363. Doing random mutagenesis at those positions essentially led to either no improvement over wt activity, or a decrease in activity.
Saturation mutagenesis. Not sequenced to determine specific mutations, but could be sequenced.
