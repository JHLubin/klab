To Do
	HCV
		Develop quantitation procedure on 2D plots that use diagonal bin counts
		Design around F2R2
	Htra1
		Order primers to put Htra1 and Htra1+PDZ into Ly104
		Design around 90 (86-92)
		Computation
			Get good cat relax
			Improve scans
			Develop better extended cat model, scan both fibril sequences
			Develop PDZ extended model
			Scan both fibrils on PDZ and ext PDZ
	UCK2
		Make constraints
		Relax the model
		Run design to find better sites
			4-thiouridine + Y65G had no activity, relates to Y112
			Stability loss around F89?
			Bigs clash with Asp62
			Maybe re-backbone 87-91 loop
	Lit
		Check for papers using split HCV
	Aliza's data
		Replace directories in silent files (not uniform throughout file)
		~/Rosetta/main/source/bin/extract_pdbs.linuxgccrelease -in::file::silent [silent_file]
		~400GB if fully extracted and gzipped

	Update design protocol
		Extend to non-HCV
		"What sorts of sequences had this mutation?"
		Add sequence change classification, compared to cannonical sequences?
		Borrow from Will's script to ditch CST files
		What to do about double-designed peptide results?
		Output which PDB to check for example of mutation
		Add further constraints to keep peptide in b-sheet
			Manasi emphasized stronger importnce of constraint scores
		Add cleaved/uncleaved indicator to sequences in by-mutation output
		Insert blank lines between sets in by-set mutations and condense_fasc
		Make design happen separately from relax, rather than after
		Double-step procedure to include forward-fold
			Do design on protease with altered substrate, take list of designs and make them static, allowing design on peptide instead and see if target substrate is recaptured.


New protocol
	Loop hashing, starting with fixed ends
	Need database of protease loops
		serine-like proteases
		check database for loops of length X that match end orientations
	Variable length build option?
	Mike Tyka, splice mover (Fleishman @ Weitzman Institute)
	Will's RMSA?
	Protocol
		centroid
			Randomly pick loop size
			Find suitable loops in database, splice in
		full-atom
			redesign interface with new loop around peptide
			rescore
			accept/reject
		Swap loops until things aren't improving much. Filter?
		If this overly favors long loops, alternative "hot spot" approach:
			Define hot spots and constrain a hot interaction
			Inverse rotamer sampling
			Backbone moved to accommodate the rotamer
			(Need to figure out which mover does this)
	Benchmark
		Recovery of native loops across set
	Thoughts
		Assessment of loop  (and full structure) flexibility, since part of loop role is in determining rigidity of the catalytic site, part in attracting the substrate, and part in positioning it
		XX(for now)Can we share loops across different types of protease, or even with wider PDB?
		Maybe jump peptide away, then insert loop, check about structure change, then put peptide back in --> filter
		Try peptide binding without constraints vs with constraints? Up CST weights?
		Water-mediation?
		Do we want a database of serine protease mutations?
		Assemble a list of experimental methods, compare to Manasi's?
		Funny thing about orientation, see fig 3
		Competitive in vitro test -- multiple discriminble peptides with designed protease, assess cleavage propensity--quantitative comparison


HTRA1
	N>C: insulin-like growth factor binding domain, kazal 2 domain, trypsin-like domain, PDZ domain
		Kazal related to protease inhibition
			N-terminal binds active site, blocks
	Does phosphorylation/other PTM influence activity?
	Conformation specificity > prefers fibrils over soluble
		More enzyme accelerates fibril degradation, not soluble
		Enzyme attack is not specific to fibril ends
		More cuts to core regions of tau when pre-treated with enzymatically inactive (active PDZ) form than wihout pretreatment
			Opens up and cuts, vs starts from tau termini then hits destabilized core
	This is complicated. Rosetta to start, QM/MM refine? HTRA1 mechanism?
	Ehrmann 2012 paper has sequences for tau cleavage. Poepsel 2015 paper includes distinction between soluble and insoluble, some time resolution.
	Trimerizes strongly in solution
		PDB structures are monomeric
	N-domain is not inhibitory
	Crystal structure includes two flawed chains, and one that is considered competent--Eigenbrot 2012. Chain B most reliable. Comparable to 3nzi from Trubenstein 2011. 3tjn from Eigenbrot 2012.
	Eigenbrot 2012 includes speculative structure for full protein from SAXS
		SI includes some cleaved sequences
	480 residues
	Loop L3 affected by PDZ binding--res 303-315
		For DegS, L3 b-sheets with peptide b-sheeted to PDZ
	Loop LD influenced by trimer--res 283-291
	Cat res H220, D250, S328
	Oxyanion hole res 325-327 on loop L1
	PDZ
		Seems to have 4-residue recognition requirement, longer hybridization
		Likes carboxyl groups at 0, but for C-terminal, likes hydrophobic side chin
		Likes W at -1
		Runyon 2007 did see some substrate specificity differences in Ala scans
		A few mutations can radically alter ubstrate specificity
			Maybe check library of PDZ's and their substrate specificities?
		Trp at -1 may bind protease and activate
		No impact on free peptide cleavage--only fibrils
	Tau
		Phosphorylation?
		2N4R

		Fibril core: 306-378
	MS data
		Oddly, most sites that have soluble cleaved but not fibril are outside core
		WT does seem to prefer hydrophobic P1
		Are fibril and soluble that different?
		Jim Wells, Subtiligase N-terminal proteomics
		Scatter correlate fibril vs soluble, 10 min, cleaved at all
			How soluble and fibril correlate changing in time?
			May need NMR here
		Vertical plot with fibril on one side, soluble on other

	DID PROTEASE CUT WITHOUT PDZ
		Tennstaedt 2012--Yes (small fragment substrate), though not as well as WT, until tau present, then cut better
 	LIT: DOES DEGRADING AMYLOIDS SHOW PROMISE AS TREATMENT AT ALL, what enzymes and fibrils? What questions can be answered, e.g mechanisms, dissolving s degrading? Will this work? Implications and significance of this tool. MOTIVATE!
	Patrick Dogherty, Kallikreins to dissolve a-beta fibrils (spelling may be wrong)
	Bone up on DegP and DegS, other Htra's
	What's with oligomerization?
	Verify no N-terminal
	Why Poepsel plots show no bars or differences between F/S?

Ideas
	Htra1
		Time study of what fragments are produced, where cuts happen first
		Take peptide that binds PDZ, verify that it is not cleaved. Then test cleavage activity in the presence of this peptide. (Wilken, 2004)
			Is there a way to check for many frames in tau cheaply?
		Put in repulsive constraints on a middle fiber to push out of alignment, then rescore. Repeat with different residues to determine where it's least unfavorable to pull apart the fibril.
		ssNMR of PDZ binding internal sequence
		Test effect of assembly on tau degradation (Jo 2014)

			Leukemia
	
	Would be nice if movemap worked with residue selectors
	Would be nice if designing with FlexPepDock didn't require flags and a resfile, had setter for score function

		How to model two-domain + substrate in near-attack
	* Compare a-synuclein and tau papers 
	Neurosin or cathepsin expression
	Note, collagenase structures referenced in Perona&Craik

Collect data on
	Assays for specificity determination
	Engineered proteases for altered specificity
		Mutations and efficacy
	Trypsin-like proteases
		Count interactions of a loop with peptide vs with the rest of the protease
		Assess how happy new loop would be in a splice
		Filter out ones that would really lose their original conformation

	From viewed AEPDIR_1
		Back-convert res 56 to Q
		V93 to glutamate when AEPDI<b>R</b>
			Run a few models to see how that goes
		Glutamate --> lysine was good
		D183K was good w/ asp 4 of peptide
		Lysine on prime side doesn't matter

	Review 2-side (prot + pep) deisgns
		How does FastDesign compare with earlier protocol
			Space of mutations, energies, etc.
