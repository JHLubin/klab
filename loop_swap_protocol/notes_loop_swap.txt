sequ align
check is one loop particularly different?

start just sequence, then compare tvmv and tev structures as validation

specificity determining residues (SRD's) based on sequence alignment
	read up
	run that analysis

psi-dali?
	Download dali, iterate searches 
	PDB90 of TEV, then of each hit (~100)
	z-score threshold 2.5
	Dali aligns--see about how

20190917
	Ran Dali online for TEV PDB (modified 1LVM). 
	Downloaded PDB90 set, 114 aligned PDB files as 0000_master_pdb.pdb
	Saved alignments as 0000_seq_align.txt
	Loaded TEV into PyMOL, and 0000_master_pdb
		Removed all heteroatoms
		Pruned down other PDBs to chain(s) that aligned with TEV
		Changed chain to A for single remaining chain proteins
