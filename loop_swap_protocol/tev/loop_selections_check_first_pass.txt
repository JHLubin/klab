96 homologs, 12 sites

287 loops were identified as possible targets

Distance excluded 603 loops
May want to switch distance selection to intergroupinterface selector. Distance okay for now.
3W94 8 Dist 8.407 with E pointed at substrate Cterm

Discontinuous excluded 285 loops
Discontinuity check is too aggressive, excluding PDBs over just misnumbered residues
Change to chain breaks
Want to exclude loops like 1FI8 1, but not 4CRE 1

B factor excluded 204 loops
May want to bump up B factor threshold to 60 (currently at 50). Would bring back 68 loops out of 204

RMSD excluded 23 loops
6BJR 1 RMSD 0.362 Seems like loop should actually be included, but spliced farther back
1A5I 2 RMSD 0.000 because only two residues. Include splice residues in RMSD calculation.
1SPJ 2 RMSD 0.259 Seems like should be included. Maybe punishing small loops too much
2AS9 8 RMSD 0.459 Might also need to be spliced farther back

Size excluded 16 loops
Size exclusion seemed good on negative side

16 loops lacked matched ends

May want to force sliding windows for alignment to always include at least two residues, or switch to BB RMSD instead of CA RMSD
5JB8 1 has cut that only makes sense by CA cutting, doesn't actually work physically


Changes:
Made discontinuity check only work on chain breaks, ignores PDB numbering
RMSD calculation made to include the splice residues, not just the loop residues
Altered splice site selection to pick two-residue frames or larger

Going to two-residue frames made 6BJR 1 worse. No change in 2AS9 8. 5JB8 1 is maybe a little better, but not good enough.
RMSD change seems to solve the problem.
Chain breaks seem to be evaluating better 

Switching back to single-residue frames with full BB RMSD seems to help a little, but there is still a splicing shortcoming
Should target B sheets

Possibly a lot better, but 5JB8 is still limited by cutting off at first mismatched residue. Remove that cutoff.
